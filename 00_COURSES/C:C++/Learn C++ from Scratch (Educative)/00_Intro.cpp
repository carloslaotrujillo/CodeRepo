#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}

// NOTE: Thereturn 0; as shown above, is not a necessary addition to the ‘hello world’ program.
// A return value of 0 in main simply signals to the operating system that everything went smoothly.
// By default, a C++ program will always return 0 if there is no return at the end of main.
